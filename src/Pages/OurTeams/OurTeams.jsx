My passion can be stationed down to helping people. Itâ€™s unbearable for me to see someone in pain and if I can help a person in need or make a stray dog wiggle its tail, my day is made. I believe we all can make an impactful change in society if our heart is full of pure intentions. At heart, I am a person who cares about the environment and children."
    const founderbold=" I strongly believe that education combined with life skills can make the world a better place for those that find it difficult to access affordable education!"
    const  lovwText="Help others without expectations, keep your intentions clear and you will be rewarded."
    const Cofounder=" Being an enterprising individual who believes in creating an impact while making an income, I believe kindness is the only thing that matters when it comes to being a part of others' lives! I really couldn't care less about where someone comes from, as long as they are willing to learn new things and hold a certain sense of empathy towards others, I'll be there for them, even when they have nothing. Helping others comes naturally to me. As much as running a whole organization that helps people is a conscious thought, helping someone isn't. "
    const cofounderbold= "Khayaal is the part of my journey that allows me to help others, fuelling my forever subconscious to help others while making the life I've always dreamed for myself!"
